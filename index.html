            </h2>
            <h3>Medical imaging informatics!</h3>
            <p> Allow me to introduce myself, I am Stella BUGAM, 25 years old, and currently a student in Medical Engineering at Wilhelmshaven University of Applied Sciences. My academic journey has been marked by complete immersion in learning and the application of various programming languages, devices, and software such as C++, Matlab, Python, OpenCV, Pycharm, Mediapipe, GitHub, Git, Catia V5, Mintab, Power BI, Linux, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Raspberry, oscilloscope, Gampt-Software, and medical products.

                This versatility has allowed me to deepen my knowledge in areas such as Biosignals and image processing, Validation and Testing, as well as Design. What truly excites me is exploring cutting-edge technologies and my commitment to contributing to the development of innovative solutions while ensuring that medical devices meet the highest standards of quality and safety.

                I also have a keen interest in artificial intelligence and data analysis, and I am constantly captivated by the rapid evolution of these fields. My thirst for learning always drives me to seize opportunities to expand my knowledge. As an enthusiast in testing and image processing, I find fulfillment in pushing my own boundaries every day. I'm currently working on a project with my partner in programming an Opensource software developed in C++, OpenCV, designed to simplify mathematical calculations as well as operations on images and audio signals.

                    <p>The determination of the signal transit time and amplitude change is the basis for the use of ultrasonic technology in  materials testing and for medical ultrasound. I conducted the technical documentation of our laboratory experiment with my partner and with the help of the connected electronics and evaluation software Gampt, the speed of sound was determined in reflection and transmission methods.

                    <h4>Biosignal_and_image_processing</h4>
                    <p>I created and analyzed various ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using both STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) and FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). In the FFT analysis, I was able to analyze and record the electrical activity of the heart over time and transfer it into the frequency domain. The resulting representation shows the amplitude of these frequency components in both the time and frequency domains.

                    <p>I have developed a programme that allows you to view photos by swiping with your hand without touching the screen, making it easier to use on non-touch PCs. This concept was programmed in 2 codes using frameworks like Pycharm, Python, Mediapipe and OpenCV. The foreground code enables hand recognition and gestures, followed by the background code that enables these photos to be viewed using gestures.

I was responsible for the design of the complete housing and switch lever, as well as the assembly of each component, using the CAD programme Catia V5. The workbook is completed with drawing derivatives and parts lists folded according to the standards.
