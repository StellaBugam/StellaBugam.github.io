                <h3>Data Analyst!</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a data analyst with over 1 years of experience in analyzing and interpreting large datasets to uncover insights and improve business performance.
                    I have worked in the health and automotive industry and my expertise lies in statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning. I am skilled in Tools and languages such as Power BI, Query, DAX, Excel, Python, R, and SQL.
                    I am passionate about using data to drive decision-making from the first ideas around what you want to measure and how to capture data accurately, through data preparation, analysis and management, all the way to impactful presentation of insights and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

                    <h3>Data collection</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the lead data analyst, the first step involves gathering and connecting to diverse data sources. I primarily use Power Query in Power BI to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from tools like Excel (as a database) and MongoDB. Power Query enables me to clean and shape raw data by merging tables, filtering unnecessary rows, and creating calculated columns directly within the Power BI environment. This process ensures that the data is well-structured, accurate, and ready for analysis. My ability to seamlessly integrate multiple data sources allows me to build a solid foundation for deeper insights.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="services-box">
                    <i class='bx bx-filter-alt'></i>
                    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the data is collected, I focus on transforming it into an analysis-ready format. Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI, I create measures and calculated columns that enable advanced calculations such as aggregations, trends, and comparisons. DAX allows me to derive meaningful insights by defining custom formulas that go beyond basic analysis. This stage ensures that the data model is robust, relationships between tables are properly defined, and all necessary transformations are complete for effective visualization.

                    <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final step of my workflow is crafting interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to communicate insights effectively. By leveraging Power BI's extensive visualization capabilities such as bar charts, line graphs, slicers, and drill-through features I create intuitive reports tailored to the audience's needs. These dashboards allow stakeholders to explore key metrics dynamically while maintaining clarity through consistent formatting and storytelling techniques. My visualizations are designed not only to present data but also to guide decision-makers toward actionable insights by highlighting trends, patterns, and anomalies in a visually engaging way.

                    <p>
                        I have a diversified expertise in the planning and implementation of testing and validation processes aimed at ensuring that products or systems fully meet the needs and requirements of patients or clients. This approach involves conducting rigorous functional tests, meticulous evaluations, and thorough verifications to ensure compliance with established standards of performance, safety, and quality, thereby ensuring a high level of stakeholder satisfaction.

                        <p>
                            To support automotive software validation, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and test result distributions for braking systems across different software versions.

                        <p>
                            The goal was to help engineering teams quickly identify performance trends, improvements, and regressions. By aggregating and comparing test data, I enabled efficient test coverage analysis and faster issue detection. The interactive visuals and dynamic filters made complex data more accessible and actionable. This project enhanced my ability to design clear, insightful dashboards that support data-driven decision-making in technical environments.
